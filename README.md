# Sorting_Visualizer
The "Sorting Visualizer" project is an interactive software application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. The project's primary goal is to help users understand how different sorting techniques work and compare their efficiency and performance. By offering a real-time visualization of sorting processes, users can gain insights into the inner workings of algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and more.
